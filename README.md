📊 Executive Overview

This Power BI project converts raw transactional car sales data into interactive, actionable business intelligence. The report provides granular insight into total sales revenue, units sold, top-performing brands, customer demographics (income status and gender distribution), and dealer-level revenue breakdown.
🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using Power Query Editor before modeling:

    Table Selection & Structuring:
        Isolated and loaded the structured data table (Car Sales xlsx - car_data) from the Excel workbook.

    Column Removal:
        Removed non-analytical fields such as customer Phone numbers to optimize performance and privacy.

    Handling Missing & Null Values:
        Handled null/blank values in Car Category by categorizing ambiguous entries and standardizing category names (Base Model, Mid-Range, Luxury).

    Data Type Formatting:

        Converted Date column to proper Date data type (DD/MM/YYYY).

        Converted numeric metrics (Price ($), Annual Income) to Fixed Decimal Number / Currency.

        Set standard text data types for categorical columns (Company, Model, Engine, Transmission, Dealer_Region, Gender).

    Text Standardizing:
        Capitalized text fields and trimmed trailing spaces across string fields for smooth visual grouping.

🔗 Data Model & Relationships

The report utilizes a Star Schema data architecture:

    Fact Table: Car Sales xlsx - car_data (Contains transactional sales records)

    Dimension Table: Dim_Date (Dedicated calendar table created using DAX)

    Relationship:
        Dim_Date[Date] 1 → * Car Sales xlsx - car_data[Date] (Single Directional, 1-to-Many).

   +------------------+             +-------------------------------+
   |     Dim_Date     | 1         * |  Car Sales xlsx - car_data    |
   +------------------+-------------+-------------------------------+
   | Date (PK)        |             | Car_id (PK)                   |
   | Year             |             | Date (FK)                     |
   | Month            |             | Company                       |
   | Year Month       |             | Model                         |
   | Quarter          |             | Price ($)                     |
   +------------------+             | Dealer_Region                 |
                                    +-------------------------------+

📐 DAX Measures

All measures were organized into a dedicated _Measures table:

// 1. Total Sales Revenue
Total Revenue = SUM('Car Sales xlsx - car_data'[Price ($)])

// 2. Total Volume Sold
Total Units Sold = COUNTROWS('Car Sales xlsx - car_data')

// 3. Average Price per Vehicle
Average Price = AVERAGE('Car Sales xlsx - car_data'[Price ($)])

// 4. Average Customer Income
Average Customer Income = AVERAGE('Car Sales xlsx - car_data'[Annual Income])

// 5. Top Revenue Generating Brand
Top Revenue Brand = 
TOPN(
    1, 
    VALUES('Car Sales xlsx - car_data'[Company]), 
    [Total Revenue], 
    DESC
)

// 6. Total Distinct Vehicle Models
Total Models Sold = DISTINCTCOUNT('Car Sales xlsx - car_data'[Model])

// 7. Top Performing Dealer
Top Dealer = 
TOPN(
    1, 
    VALUES('Car Sales xlsx - car_data'[Dealer_Name]), 
    [Total Revenue], 
    DESC
)

// 8. Verified Customer Percentage (Ignoring Slicer Context Filters)
Verified Customer % = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS('Car Sales xlsx - car_data'), 
        'Car Sales xlsx - car_data'[Income_Status] = "Verified",
        REMOVEFILTERS('Car Sales xlsx - car_data'[Income_Status])
    ),
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS('Car Sales xlsx - car_data'),
        REMOVEFILTERS('Car Sales xlsx - car_data'[Income_Status])
    ),
    0
)
